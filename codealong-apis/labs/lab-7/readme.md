# Lab 7 Readme

## Lab Goal

Identify additional datasets that could be useful as an API


## Lab Steps

1. On a piece of paper, write the question: What information sources does GSA have?

2. Spend 1 minute writing as many answers as you can think of, with one line for each.

Example: City Pairs rates

3. For the items listed in step 2, identify the source organization or application. If you don't know, guess.

Example: GSA Travel Management sets City Pairs rates


3. For the items listed in step 2, identify 1 organization or application INSIDE GSA that might use this data. If you think they already use it, go ahead and list them anyway.

Example: Concur might use the city pairs rates from the API to set airline prices.

4. For the items listed in step 2, identify 1 agency or customer OUTSIDE GSA that might use this data. If you think they already use it, go ahead and list them anyway.

Example: Dept. of Treasury might use the City Pairs rates to estimate travel costs for a conference.

5. Share with the group.
